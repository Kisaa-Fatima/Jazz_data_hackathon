#Introduction:
The Super Store Dashboard project aims to provide insightful analysis and visualizations of a Super Store dataset. By performing EDA and creating custom interactive visualizations using tableau, we have highlighted hidden patterns and trends within the data. The resulting dashboards and user stories effectively convey the meaningful insights derived from the analysis.

#Dataset:
The dataset used in this project was provided by Jazz company and contains information related to sales, customers, products, and other relevant aspects of a Super Store.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
To understand the dynamics of the dataset, we performed comprehensive EDA. This included:

#Data cleaning and preprocessing
Descriptive statistics
Identifying key metrics
Analyzing sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends

#Custom Visualizations
We created custom interactive visualizations to highlight hidden patterns and trends in the dataset. These visualizations include:

-Sales performance over time
-Customer segmentation and behavior analysis
-Product category performance
-Geographic distribution of sales
-supply chain optimization, revenue growth, trend and predictive analysis


#Dashboards
The final dashboards provide an interactive way to explore the insights derived from the data. These dashboards are designed to be user-friendly and provide a comprehensive overview of the key findings.

User Stories
To effectively convey the meaning of our analysis, we created user stories that illustrate the practical applications of the insights. These stories help stakeholders understand how the findings can be leveraged for decision-making and strategic planning.
